MailClient
==========

An email client written with the JavaMail API

Users can send email fairly easily.
Users can receive email, but they can't be read, which makes the receiving feature fairly useless.

Pre-Requisites:
  MySQL Server running. The credentials for the MySQL server are hard-coded.
  JavaMail API somewhere in the CLASSPATH
  Add credentials to the MySQL database by running the AccountAdmin constructor
  
Todo: LOTS!
  Automate account creation
  Make the 'menu' work
  Figure out how to package this thing
  Make a 'logged-in' check
  Add a log-in, log-out feature
  Multiple users on the same machine
